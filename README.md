# RightJS Documentation

This is the [RightJS](http://rightjs.org) JavaScript framework documentation
repository.

All the files are situated inside of the `docs/` directory. See the `docs/README.md`
file for the information about formatting and documentation structure

## Test Application

There is also a dummy application available, that will let you see the
texts in a layout close to the one on the official site.

It's a simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) based Ruby application,
to fire it up you'll need the Ruby environment, plus the following gems

    sudo gem install sinatra maruku json

After that simply fire it up like that

    ./index.rb

And open the following address in your browser

    http://localhost:3000
