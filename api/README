I'm not sure about the exact format for now. Just keep it simple and more or less close to the RDoc formatting system.

The folders and file names should follow the files and folders structure of the source code directory.

Every method description should look kinda like that.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

### Klass#method

== Semantic
  method(...) -> return type
  
== Description
  Short description in here
  
== Example
  Some usage example in here
  
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

And when you refer to any method in the system make it like {Klass#method} and {Klass.method}, so we could link them together later.


This is pretty much it for now.
