RightJS provides the global object called <tt>Browser</tt> which become more
or less standard among JavaScript frameworks.

There are the keys

  IE            - Internet Explorer of any version
  Opera         - Opera browser
  WebKit        - WebKit based browser
  Gecko         - Gecko based browser
  MobileSafari  - The MobileSafari browser
  Konqueror     - KDE browser
  
  OLD           - an internal marker for Internet Explorer version lower than 8
  
This is pretty much it, no magic.
