# RightJS Philosophy

JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in those days. But it
is also the most hated one. Which is kinda sucks, because we are doomed to
deal with client-side scripting in the nearest future.

And that brings us to the idea of RightJS.


## Why Do We Do That?

RightJS is not about some super-duper features, it's not about writing less or
writing better either. RightJS is all about making the developer happy. It is
about getting rid of the dirty JavaScript hackery as much as possible. It is
about making JavaScript development a civilized and controllable process.


## How Do We Do That?

RightJS takes its inspiration in things like Ruby and Rails. And just like
Ruby or Rails, RightJS is very simple and casual in everyday use. It has a
standard and mostly familiar API, and it offers lots of shortcuts, syntax
sugar and handy features.

But, RightJS is also very powerful when you need to implement something
serious. It provides a fully featured consistent OOP environment, shared
modules, OOP dom-wrappers, uniformed events handling, and so one and so one.
Everything a full grown developer needs.


## What Do We Have?

We have a very tiny and blazingly fast RightJS core that doesn't force you to
get the things done one way or another. You always have a choice, use
procedural, object-oriented or functional approach, and do that in a clean,
civilized way.

That is what makes RightJS a tool that feels right.
