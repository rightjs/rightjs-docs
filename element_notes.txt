Why not extend the Element.prototype

Because in IE it will not work anyway. And so if you will write a crossbrowsing code like a mature man,
then you might end up checking something on Gecko and forget about it on IE. And it might pass some time
before you notice the issue.

For the moment that's the point.

Just use the $ function and the framework selectors as it meant and your code will work everywhere.

For each Element.Methods method we have got an Element class level method which will get executed
on an incoming element without actual extending of the element, which may be useful when you need
to have a lot of quick checks of elements out of the DOM structure.

The methods are not declared in any actual code, but getting generated automatically out of the
Element.Methods module. That's a tricky business, so watch out for your fancy hacking in the code
to keep the generator happy.
