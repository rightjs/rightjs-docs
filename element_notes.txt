We don't support static non-extensive calls for the element unit.

The policy is following.

There are quite a lot of Element unit extensions in the framework and it makes quite a big deal in terms of time consumption to extend every requested element. So we extend the HTMLElement unit prototype, so that every element had all the extensions instantly. This works perfectly in WebKit, Gecko and Opera engines, and should be working in IE8. Old IE browsers will need the extending anyway so we keep the functionality for them.

So we don't need static methods for all the modern browsers, and as for IE7 and zombie IE6, those browsers probably will hand around the next 20 years, so we provide them the same exact functionality via the $ function, but we basically oriented to the future and won't bend the system to support them nicely.

For IE7,8 browsers to make them support the native querySelector methods you need to specify
the following string on the page head line

<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8">
