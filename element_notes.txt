Why not extend the Element.prototype

Because in IE it will not work anyway. And so if you will write a crossbrowsing code like a mature man,
then you might end up checking something on Gecko and forget about it on IE. And it might pass some time
before you notice the issue.

For the moment that's the point.

Just use the $ function and the framework selectors as it meant and your code will work everywhere.
